I am a researcher focusing on **urban agriculture**, with particular interests in **branding**, **market orientation**, and **consumer behavior** in sustainable food systems. My work combines survey methods (Likert, **Best–Worst Scaling**), **structural equation modeling** (SEM), and discrete-choice approaches to understand how brand strategies and external information shape willingness-to-pay and farm performance.

Current projects include:
- **Brand orientation and performance** in urban farms (mediation/moderation via sustainability practices).  
- **Consumer choice for local produce** in large cities, integrating spatial access and competing **sales channels**.  
- **Psychological capital** of farm managers and its role in decision-making under land, labor, and tax constraints.

**Keywords:** urban agriculture; branding & market orientation; consumer choice; spatial behavior; sustainability; SEM; BWS.
